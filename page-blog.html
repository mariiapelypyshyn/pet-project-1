<p class="blog-text blog-more-text">Looking to upgrade your sweater collection this fall? Us, too; and this year, we’re even more interested than ever in what our favorite styles of sweaters are made of and how that affects their practicality. A sweater material can change the whole experience, so it’s important to know what you are looking for in a sweater and which material can help you best meet your vision. Sweater materials can seem quite complicated, which is why we have put together this handy guide to help all your sweater dreams come true. </p>
<p class="blog-text blog-more-text">
Sweater materials can seem quite complicated </p>
<p class="blog-text  blog-more-text ">
When peeking at the tag on the inside of your sweater, you'll find the specific material, whether it be 100% cashmere or multiple materials such as 70% wool, 20% acrylic, and 10% cashmere.</p>

  <h5 class="blog-text explore-more-sub">WOOL</h5>
<p class="blog-text blog-more-text">Wool is the most common material for sweaters and can refer to a variety of animal fibers. This natural material is perfect for function, style, and comfort. Wools are also often long-lasting and high-quality, meaning you will get to enjoy their fabulous fuzziness for years to come. Wool can include sheep’s wool, rabbit’s angora, alpaca, and other natural animal-based fibers. These animals are typically bred and raised for their coats, which are humanely sheared once they’ve reached a certain length to be woven into thread for clothing and other uses.</p>
<h4 class="explore-more-artcl">These animals are <br> typically bred and raised <br> for their coats</h4>
<p class="blog-text blog-more-text blog-more-text-lch">One of the most commonly used wool in sweaters is Merino sheep’s wool. Merino wool is known for being hydrophilic, meaning it can absorb up to 30% of its weight in water, making it a great weatherproof choice of sweater. Women’s wool sweaters, including cashmere, can be made from a mix of materials. This can make the wool less itchy and more comfortable to wear. If you prefer a pure wool sweater, consider wearing a thermal or shirt underneath to offset any potential itching, though that itchiness typically subsides after a few wears and washes.</p>
